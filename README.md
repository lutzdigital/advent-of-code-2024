# Advent Of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions to the popular [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) coding competition for the year 2024. You can use the contained code and comments as a help f√ºr solving the tasks yourself.

## Running the code

The code is writeen in C#. The repository contains a Visual Studio 2022 solution file, with .NET 8 console programs for every day.
For running these projects you have to:
- Sign up at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) to get access to the puzzle text and and the puzzle input. Please note that for every AoC user, the puzzle input is different.
- Get your puzzle input for the corresponding day and paste it into the (currently empty file) ``data/input.txt`` of the project sub-folder.
- Run the project; usually there is a simpler task 1 and and a more complex task 2 for every day.

## About the code

I added some comments to explain how the solutions work.
